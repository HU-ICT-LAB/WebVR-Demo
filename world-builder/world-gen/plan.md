## Plan
I plan on using the perlin noise algorithm. This produces a map which i can transform into a world in a frame! I have looked a some other algorithms but this one seemed to be the most used for this purpose. I did not do a lot of research *yet* into this excact algorithm but i did choose to focus on this one.

## TODO
- [x] Choose 1 algorithm
- [ ] Understand this algorithm
- [ ] Program this algorithm (javascript ?!?!?!)
- [ ] Implement it into a-frame (next user story)
